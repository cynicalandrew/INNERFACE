    Note that operating system can be changed, but remember to make needed changes to build settings. This guide is written for sudo package installer.



Linux Installation:
FOR DEVELOPERS: If you're interested in forking or building the repository yourself, you're encouraged to download the source files directly from the repository.
                A list of all dependancies can be found within "start.sh", so make sure to install node, npm, and all required packages from npm before attempting to build.

FOR MOST USERS: Download the zip for your preferred system from the following drive:
                https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ABG3MTd1Q8Twk6RJzmy0a9EaWh6lBj2a?dmr=1&ec=wgc-drive-hero-goto
                Apologies for the large file!! Blame electron ;-;
Download the zipped build file, extract, open a terminal inside of the folder, and run the following commands:
    chmod +x setup.sh
    sudo ./setup.sh

Wait for setup.sh to finish...

You are now able to:

1. Run the application manually:
    reboot
After reboot, open a console in the build directory:
    ./start.sh

2. Set the application to run on device startup:
    1.  Open Startup Applications via the Activities overview.
        Alternatively you can press Alt+F2 and run the gnome-session-properties command.

    2.  Click Add and enter the command to be executed at login (name and comment are optional).
        For example, to make Firefox start automatically, it's sufficient to type firefox in the Command field and confirm with Add.
